The App has been adapted to the new electricity rate system that has been applied since June 1, 2021. One of the main changes introduced by the regulations is that all customers covered by the PVPC are grouped under the same toll rate called 2.0. TD, which replaces the previous three (the default rate 2.0 A, the night rate 2.0 DHA, and the electric vehicle rate 2.0 DHS).

This new 2.0 TD rate has a time discrimination in three periods: peak, flat and valley that are defined according to the day of the week, the time of day and the geographical territory (different for Ceuta and Melilla).

The App includes a tool that calculates and orders the cheapest time slots of the day (average prices) for a specific time interval. For example, it is useful to know the best time of day to run the washer and dryer consecutively.
